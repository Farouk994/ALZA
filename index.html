                    <p>
                        Alza is a non-profit and
                        multi-disciplinary arts space in Ottawa’s Prince Of Whales
                        neighborhood that presents emerging artists and musicians. In order to encourage submissions
                        from a
                        diverse pool of artists, the gallery widely promotes an open proposal process and does not
                        charge
                        submission or exhibition fees. Alza strives to make art accessible to all community members;
                        our
                        art exhibitions are free of charge and all music events are open to audiences on a
                        pay-what-you-can
                        basis. Alza also hosts regular community events to help promote public discourse through
                        discussion and education. The gallery offers internships that mentor young artists on how to run
                        an
                        art gallery while learning entrepreneurial skills. In 2018, the organization also extended its
                        educational program by partnering with the Parks District in Wicker Park to teach children art.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 1997, Farouk Kisuule established Heaven in the Flat Iron Building in Island Park, Ottawa. In
                        July
                        2000, the gallery moved across the street to its current location at 1550 N. Milwaukee Ave. Over
                        the
                        past 19 years, Alza Gallery has established itself as a launching pad for Canadian artists in
                        all
                        media including painting, sculpture, photography, film, and digital art. Alza has monthly
                        exhibitions as well as various video and film programs on a regular basis. Some of the featured
                        artists include Marie Kennedy, Doug Lussenhop, Eric Fensier, Cat Chow, Doug Fogelson, Stephen
                        Eichhorn, Jason Lazarus, Mika Horbuchi, and many others. Early Heaven musical performances
                        include
                        Dark Dark Dark, Anni Rossi, and Angel Olsen. In 2011, the organization added a small vintage
                        shop to
                        the front of the gallery to help fund the program. Since opening the shop, our outreach has
                        expanded
                        to a whole new audience with hundreds of people visiting every weekend.
